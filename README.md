# MTL-XF-032 — Retail Customer Value Returns Product Mix Intelligence

**Track:** Cross-Functional · **Use case:** Commercial / private sector · **Team:** 6–8 · **Duration:** 8 weeks

This is a simulated confidential-client engagement using public/open data. Stakeholders and commercial/security scenarios are fictional. Do not claim real-client employment, endorsement, operational deployment or realised benefits. This master pack specifies work to be completed; it does not claim the team has executed it.

## Business commission

**Client:** Confidential Multimarket Online Retailer. **Decision owner:** Commercial Director. **Cadence:** quarterly customer and merchandising review.

Sales totals hide cancellation activity, missing customer identities and concentrated product demand. Commercial managers need a reconciled view of gross sales, negative adjustments and customer value before assigning retention offers or changing the product range.

**Decision:** Choose up to ten customer segments, product groups or country markets for retention and merchandising investigation.

## End-to-end delivery

Deliver business requirements, governed source acquisition, engineering and data quality, seven defined metrics, baseline/alternative policy comparison, decision dashboard, assurance/UAT, executive recommendation and operational handover. A model alone is insufficient.

Baseline ranks country × product combinations by positive sales value; alternative ranks by absolute negative-adjustment value / positive sales value with zero denominators unavailable. Customer action compares RFM quintile segments; top ten opportunities include known-customer coverage.

## Core dataset and frozen cohort

**S1:** [Online Retail II](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502). **Input:** online_retail_II.xlsx. **Source population:** 1,067,371 source invoice lines across two worksheets.

Read both original workbook worksheets. Core complete-month window is 2009-12-01 00:00 inclusive to 2011-12-01 00:00 exclusive; retain December 2011 rows outside core with explicit exclusion counts. Freeze customer segmentation at 2011-12-01.

C-prefixed invoices identify cancellations; negative quantities are adjustment evidence, not confirmed physical returns. There is no cost of goods, profit margin, marketing spend or confirmed return reason. Missing CustomerID rows remain in commercial totals but cannot be assigned to customer RFM.

No raw data are uploaded by this update. Teams preserve original bytes outside Git in an approved durable snapshot, with checksums, source metadata and reviewer access. The source register records verification evidence and acquisition rules.

## Evaluation and policy boundary

Descriptive/RFM core requires no predictive model. Use reference date 2011-12-01 and positive, non-cancellation invoices for RFM. Optional forecasting must use chronological rolling holdouts, never random line splitting.

**Primary risk:** Removing negative lines or missing customers before revenue accounting would overstate value and conceal coverage.

At G1 (week 2), approve requirements, source rights, actual schema and frozen bytes. At G2 (week 4), approve row accounting, all seven metrics and evaluation design. At G3 (week 6), review baseline/alternative and uncertainty. At G4 (week 8), require all twelve deliverables, ten executed domain tests, three UAT tasks, five reconciliations and a distinct-member clean rerun.

Assign named authors and review partners. Unsupported mandatory outputs remain blocked until an approved source/scope change resolves them. Record actual results in a separate Mettelo team repository; this master defines the work.
