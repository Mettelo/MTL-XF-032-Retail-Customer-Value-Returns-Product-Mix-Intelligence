# MTL-XF-032 — Raw-data preservation

**No raw data are uploaded by this update.** This directory documents the strategy; it does not assert that input payloads are in Git.

Acquire online_retail_II.xlsx from [S1 exact URL and checked-byte reference](../SOURCE_REGISTER.md). Retain original archive/members/codebooks outside Git in an immutable S1-v1 snapshot; record retrieval UTC, URL, filename, bytes and SHA-256. Keep a recoverable copy with retention owner and reviewer access.

**Frozen scope:** Read both original workbook worksheets. Core complete-month window is 2009-12-01 00:00 inclusive to 2011-12-01 00:00 exclusive; retain December 2011 rows outside core with explicit exclusion counts. Freeze customer segmentation at 2011-12-01.

Read both workbook worksheets with explicit header mapping (Invoice, Price, Customer ID). Preserve sheet and original row lineage; source-line identity is not Invoice×StockCode.

Never overwrite, edit, re-encode or deduplicate originals. Extract into a separate working area; transformations, exclusions and parsed labels belong in code and curated outputs with source-row lineage. Check original and extracted byte hashes before analysis. A mismatch or missing approved snapshot blocks processing until resolved.

Team repositories should ignore local raw payloads while tracking this guidance and metadata. Do not remove any previously supplied raw data without explicit approval. Store access instructions without credentials and document restoration from retained bytes if upstream changes.
